# Grids

CSS Grid Layout is a **two-dimensional layout system** for the web. It lets you **lay content** out **in rows** and **columns**.

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a **2-dimensional system**, meaning it can **handle both columns and rows**, unlike [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a **parent element** \(which becomes the `Grid Container`\) and to that element's **children** \(which become `Grid Items`\).
